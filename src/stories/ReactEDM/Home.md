# ReactEDM

ReactEDM, or React Extensible Dispaly Manager, is a react component for displaying control screens in the browser. Currently, it supports the BOB file format from [CSS Phoebus](https://controlssoftware.sns.ornl.gov/css_phoebus/) and ADL files from [MEDM](https://epics.anl.gov/extensions/medm/index.php).

## How this works

UI files are taken from github (see Q&A to see where to link the github) via the useUIData util file.
